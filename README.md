# 👋 Pedro Henrique

**Full Stack Engineer**

I build digital products with a strong focus on **real business impact**, **user experience**, and **end-to-end workflows that actually work**.  
I currently work on a **global product**, with a distributed team and headquarters in the UK, developing solutions that connect acquisition, onboarding, and user activation in a clear and scalable way.

My work goes beyond implementing features. I focus on **product flows**, **UX decisions**, and how software can reduce friction for both users and internal teams.  
I have experience building everything from **landing pages and conversion funnels** to **guided onboardings** and complex dashboards, always prioritizing simplicity, clarity, and operational efficiency.

## **Professional projects**

### **Guimaps**
A tourism platform that connects **licensed guides, local partners, and travelers** in a single ecosystem.

I worked as a **Full Stack Engineer**, building:
- A dashboard for guides to manage tours and experiences  
- A dashboard for partners (bars, venues, event spaces, etc.) to offer their services  
- A flow for travelers to create **custom itineraries**, combining tours and partner experiences  

This project was strongly focused on **UX**, **complex workflow design**, and multiple user roles.

### Borderless Coding (UK Startup)
Worked at a global company focused on:
- User acquisition and conversion funnels (quizzes, landing pages, seasonal campaigns such as Black Friday)  
- **Guided onboarding experiences** for user activation  
- Reducing operational friction and reliance on manual support  

Projects were built with **Next.js** and deployed on **Cloudflare**, prioritizing performance, reliability, and clear user flows.

## 📌 Relevant projects

### **DxGen**
A **Developer Experience** product that automates one of the most ignored (and painful) problems for developers: **documentation**.

I worked as a **Full Stack Engineer**, including the **AI layer**, building an agent that:
- Understands the project and repository context  
- Automatically generates and updates documentation  
- Creates READMEs, architecture diagrams, and code summaries  
- Analyzes pull requests and produces mini-docs with potential issues  

The main goal was to design an **extremely simple user flow**, turning a boring task into something almost invisible.
